## Log and annoucements 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Problem Set 1** is available. It is due on **6.11.2023, 11:59 PM**. You can submit your code by email or (preferably) by sharing a self-contained repository with all required files inside.

+ 23/10: we finished the topic of optimization by spending some time on constrained optimization; we saw how to draw random numbers in Julia and started talking about spectral methods.
+ 16/10: we talked about multidimensional unconstrained optimization: Newton, polytope methods, direction methods.
+ 9/10: we talked about unidimensional unconstrained optimization: bracketing methods and Newton's method.

## How to start using Julia
Follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia). Please use Julia 1.9.3.

Once you completed all these steps press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> in VS Code (alternatively press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> to get the command palette and find the shortcut). This should start Julia REPL and you will see green `julia` text in the terminal. Input <kbd>]</kbd> (right square bracket) in the terminal. This should change text from green to blue (ahd you should see something like `1.9`). Type `add IJulia` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>. This will download a package that allows you to use Jupyter notebooks with Julia.
